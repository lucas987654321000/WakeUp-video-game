This is a project I created with a team of five (including myself) in my Video Game Design class in school.
Our team had about 2 months to create this project from scratch, so there are a couple of bugs detailed in
another readme file (see below).

The project involved our team to utilize various fields of CS, including (but not limited to):
1. User Experience (UX)
2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
3. Event Driven Programming
4. Computer Graphics (modeling, lighting, textures, etc.)
5. Computer Audio
6. Countless other fields

There is another readme inside the folder /TeamGalaxian_WakeUp/ that details some of the specific contributions
of each team member, however, everyone utilized each of the above fields to complete their portion of the project.

I learned a lot from this project, not just in regards to video game design, but also to working with a team that
has many different ideas and visions going in different directions. While I have worked on software development
projects before and am no stranger to AGILE methodology, this particular project gave me experience in merging
multiple people's ideas into one final project. For a project such as a video game, where every member wants to
express their ideas differently, communication is vital and I am proud to have completed this video game in an
efficient manner with a professional group of students. Acting as the team lead, I not only led meetings, but I
also helped forge the final design of our video game, culminating everyone's ideas and opinions into one vision.
I also worked with members who were struggling in their designated tasks to ensure they received adequate support
and did not turn in deliverables late.
